# NeoDepends Python Dependencies
#
# These packages are required to run NeoDepends dependency analysis
# Install with: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: NeoDepends primarily uses Python's standard library.
# No external packages are strictly required for basic functionality.

# Optional: If you want to use tree-sitter-graph features directly
# (already bundled in release binaries, so this is optional)
# tree-sitter-graph>=0.1.0
